# 30 Days of JavaScript challenge

This repository includes my answers for the [30 Days of Javascript](https://javascript30.com/) challenge by Wes Bos.

## What does it do?

Each daily project includes a web page (index.html) with some JS functionalities, such a drum kit, an analogue clock or buttons to change CSS settings on an object. These functionalities may be further developed or used in other projects.

## How to install/download?

Each daily challenge is in its own subdirectory and the code may be viewed there. You can fork, clone or download the repo freely by using Github's _fork_ or _Clone or download_ buttons.

## What is the goal of this project?

The purpose of the challenge is to practice vanilla JS with different kinds of small projects. I want to develop my JS skills by doing something outside of tutorials, and this challenge gives me the opportunity to test and improve my JS knowledge.

## Used technologies

- JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)
- HTML
- CSS
